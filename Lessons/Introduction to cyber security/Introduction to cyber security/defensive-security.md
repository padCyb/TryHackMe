# DEFENSIVE SECURITY INTRODUCTION 


## SOC : Security Operation Center

Correspond to a team a cyber security professional that analyses the network in order to detect intrusion or attack.
Keep a close eye on vulnerabilities, rules of security policies not respected, unauthorized activities and network intrusions.

## DFIR : Digital Forensic And Intrusion Response.

The digital Forensic is the analysis of a system after an attack. Report the damages and file system modifications, verify if any malicious program is still running, check system and network logs.
Incident response, the name is explicit but 4 steps has to be followed :
- preparation : the team has to be trained to handle incident and do prevention.
- detection/analysis :  the team needs to be equipped in order to detect an intrusion and understand how bad the system is affected.
- containment / eradication / recovery : avoid an attack to spread to other device, delete the intrusion and recover the system.
- post-incident activities : making a report about the intrusion, why it occursed and what should be done to avoid it in the future.

## Malware analysis

There is 2 way to analyse a malware 
- Static analysis : without running the program, requires a strong knowledge to assembly langage.
- Synamic analysis : running the program into a controlled environment so we can understand how it works.

## SIEM : System Information and Event Management
Gather information about events that occurs to a system, present them into a GUI. We can detect suspicious activites.

If we have a suspicion about an IP address we can check databases, accessible by web, they list malicious IP address (AbuseIPDB, Cisco Talos Intelligence)
