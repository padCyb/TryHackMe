## Website content discovery
**robot.txt** is a file that provides to crawlers a list of forbidden endpoints. We may discover depositories with vulnerabilities.

The **favicon** by default gives us information about the framework used. The following database list the equivalence between favicon hash and framework https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_favicon_database.  
We can download and get fav md5 with 
>curl site/fav... | md5sum

Contrary to robot.txt the **sitemap.xml** file list what endpoint are authorized for crawlers. Still we may see hidden of difficult to get endpoint and even old sites that are forgotten.

**curl** address -v can shows programation language used or even the server's version.

**OSINT Wappalyser** : online, info of website structure.

**Wayback machine** : https://archive.org/web/ archive the web, we can discover old pages of a website.

**GIT** : we can research company name to access to a public repo and look at the source code and evently credentials.

**S3 buckets** : often http(s)://{name}.s3.amazonaws.com, we can get url from git repo. Maybe we can find files with opened permissions.

**dirb webAddress /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt** : take a list of files name and check if they exist. fuff and goBuster does the same.
